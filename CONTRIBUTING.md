cd episodes/01-fundamentals/url-shortener-example
npm install

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Use simple, clear language** - Explain complex concepts simply
- **Include practical examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Add code snippets** - Make concepts tangible
- **Use analogies** - Help readers relate to familiar concepts
- **Structure content logically** - Follow a clear learning progression

### Episode Structure
Each episode should follow this structure:
```markdown
# Episode X: Topic Name

## What You'll Learn
- Clear learning objectives

## Core Concepts
- Main content with examples

## Practical Example
- Hands-on implementation

## Deep Dive
- Advanced topics and considerations

## Key Takeaways
- Summary and action items

## What's Next
- Preview of upcoming content
```

### Code Examples
- **Use TypeScript/JavaScript** for consistency
- **Include comprehensive comments** 
- **Follow clean code principles**
- **Add error handling** and validation
- **Include tests** when possible
- **Document API endpoints** clearly

## Visual Content Guidelines

### Diagrams
- Use **Mermaid** for system diagrams (renders in GitHub)
- Create **high-resolution images** for complex diagrams
- Use **consistent color schemes** across diagrams
- Include **alternative text** for accessibility

### Example Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        U[Users]
        M[Mobile App]
        W[Web App]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Layer"
        G[API Gateway]
    end
    
    U --> M
    U --> W
    M --> G
    W --> G
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Content Testing
- **Check all links** work correctly
- **Verify code examples** compile and run
- **Test instructions** on fresh environment
- **Validate diagrams** render properly

### Code Testing
```bash
# Run tests for backend
cd backend
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Check code coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
