## Episode 1: System Design Fundamentals

**[Watch the Video](http://youtube.com/@ThatNotesGuy) | [Read the Notes](./episodes/01-fundamentals/) | [View Presentation](./episodes/01-fundamentals/presentation/)**

### What You'll Learn:
- What is System Design and why it matters
- High-Level Design (HLD) vs Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Real example: Designing a URL Shortener
- Hands-on: Build your first system architecture

### Key Concepts Covered:
```
System Design = Software Architecture Blueprint
├── High-Level Design (HLD) - The Big Picture
│   ├── Major Components & Services
│   ├── Technology Stack Decisions
│   ├── Data Flow Architecture
│   └── Third-party Integrations
└── Low-Level Design (LLD) - The Details
    ├── Classes, Methods & Data Structures
    ├── Database Schemas & Relationships
    ├── Algorithms & Implementation Logic
    └── Error Handling & Edge Cases
```

## Episode 2: Monoliths vs Microservices

**[Watch the Video](http://youtube.com/@ThatNotesGuy) | [Read the Notes](./episodes/02-monolith-microservices/)**

### What You'll Learn:
- What monolithic architecture is and when to use it
- What microservices architecture is and its benefits
- Real-world examples: Netflix's evolution and Uber's architecture
- Practical decision framework for choosing between approaches

### Key Concepts Covered:
```
Architecture Patterns Comparison
├── Monolithic Architecture
│   ├── Single Codebase & Deployable Unit
│   ├── Shared Resources & Database
│   ├── Advantages: Simple, Fast, Easy to Debug
│   └── Challenges: Scalability, Technology Lock-in
└── Microservices Architecture
    ├── Independent Services & Databases
    ├── Distributed System Architecture
    ├── Advantages: Scalability, Flexibility, Fault Isolation
    └── Challenges: Complexity, Operational Overhead
```

## Episode 3: Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements

**[Watch the Video](http://youtube.com/@ThatNotesGuy) | [Read the Notes](./episodes/03-functional-nonfunctional-requirements/)**

### What You'll Learn:
- What requirements are and why they're critical to system design
- The difference between functional and non-functional requirements
- How to identify and document both requirement types
- Real-world example: Online bookstore requirements breakdown
- The requirements elicitation process

### Key Concepts Covered:
```
Requirements = Foundation of System Design
├── Functional Requirements (WHAT the system does)
│   ├── User Actions & Features
│   ├── System Operations & Business Logic
│   ├── Data Processing & Integrations
│   └── Example: User can create account, add to cart, checkout
└── Non-Functional Requirements (HOW WELL it performs)
    ├── Performance: Response time, load time
    ├── Scalability: Concurrent users, data growth
    ├── Availability: Uptime (99.9%, 99.99%)
    ├── Security: Encryption, authentication, compliance
    ├── Usability: User experience, accessibility
    ├── Maintainability: Code quality, integration time
    └── Portability: Cross-platform, deployment flexibility
```
